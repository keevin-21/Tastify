        "content": "Authentic Rag√π Bolognese requires patience and precision. Registered with Bologna's Chamber of Commerce, the official recipe demands 4+ hours of gentle simmering. The sauce layers flavors gradually: soffritto base, ground meats, wine reduction, tomatoes, and milk for richness. Each element must cook completely before adding the next."
